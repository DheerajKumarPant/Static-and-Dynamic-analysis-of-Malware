Dynamic Analysis
----------------

TO RUN: in terminal or cmd type python Dynamic.py

NOTE: A prompt 'Enter the path' will displayed, where you have to give the full path of directory where files to be analyzed are present.
The output file i.e., Dynamic.csv will be created in the same location as that of Dynamic.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LANGUAGE USED: python 3
-----------------------

LIBRARIES USED:

os --> used to list the directories so that i can iterate over it.
pandas --> i have used pandas DataFrame in the end.
picke --> to load the model i have used pickle.
csv --> to write the output data into csv file i used it.
------------------------------------------------------------------

MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:
I have used 'Decision Tree' model for dynamic analysis.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments inside the code will explain the logic of how the script is working.

Thanks.
